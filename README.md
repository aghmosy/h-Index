# Introduction
Using SOM (Self Organizing Map) to cluster authors based on their number of papers and each papers citations

# SOM
Self Organizing Map is an unsupervised learning algorithm that can be used to cluster data into a two dimentional Map.
Or i can be used for dimentional reduction purposes. It receives all the features of yours and returns a two-dimention data output.

# h-index
It is a globaly accepted metric to measure the performance of the authors.
We are studying to introduce a new metric that can suggest a better evaluation.
With h-index many researchers with different outputs can be grouped into the same h-index.

As part of our project we needed to cluster the authors for a better classification.
We used SOM to cluster them and the code here provides the details on how to performa the task.
